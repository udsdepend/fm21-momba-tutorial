# Interactive Game

We first have to add a few dependencies to our package:
```
python3 -m poetry add asciimatics
python3 -m poetry add click
```

[Asciimatics](https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics) is a package for creating full-screen console UIs and [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) is a package for parsing command line arguments.


```{admonition} Exercise

The file `fmracer/model.py` provides a skeleton of the model which you have to complete by filling in the gaps.
Each gap comes with some detailed instructions and hints what you need to do.
The instructions often contains links to Momba's [documentation](https://momba.dev).
Learning how to use the documentation is an integral part of this exercise as this helps you down the road when using Momba for your own projects.
