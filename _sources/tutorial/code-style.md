# Consistent Code Style

Controversial and often simply a matter of taste.
However, consistent style makes code more readable by others.
This is good, especially in academia.
We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) a formatter provided by the *Python Software Foundation*.

[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

Note that by using the provided VS Code workspace, VS Code is already configured to highlight violations of the Python style guidelines.
You can disable them in `workspace.code-workspace` if you like to.
