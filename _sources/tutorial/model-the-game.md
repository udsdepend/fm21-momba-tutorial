# Model the Game

It is now time to get hands-on and construct a model of the jump'n'run game with Momba.

```{admonition} Exercise

The file `fmracer/model.py` provides a skeleton of the model which you have to complete by filling in the gaps.
You have to complete the function `construct_model` which takes a track and a failure probability as arguments.
Each gap comes with detailed instructions and hints what you need to do.
The instructions often contain links to Momba's [documentation](https://momba.dev).
Learning how to use the documentation is an integral part of this exercise as this helps you down the road when using Momba for your own projects.
```

The file `solutions/model.py` contains a possible solution.
