# Best Practices

Before you get to write any code, here are a few best practices for writing  Python programs in academia.
These best practices generalize to other programming languages as well â€“ however, our focus here will be on how to realize them for Python projects.
Naturally, what counts as *best* is not always clearly defined and sometimes simply a matter of taste.
For this tutorial, we stick to established community practices where possible.
