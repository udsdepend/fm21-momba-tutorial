# Getting Started

To get started, you first have to obtain the example project for the tutorial.

If you have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed, clone the example project with:
```
git clone https://github.com/udsdepend/fm21-momba-tutorial.git
```
Otherwise, you can also [download the example project as a ZIP file](https://github.com/udsdepend/fm21-momba-tutorial/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

After cloning the example project or extracting the ZIP file, you find a file `workspace.code-workspace` in the cloned or extracted folder.
This file defines a [VS Code *workspace*](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces).
To open the workspace run:
```
code workspace.code-workspace
```
Alternatively, you can also open the workspace from within VS Code: To this end, open the *command palette* by pressing `F1`, type *File: Open Workspace from File*, and hit the enter key:

```{image} ./images/vscode-open-workspace.png
:name: vscode-open-workspace
:align: center
```

Then, choose the `workspace.code-workspace` file to open the workspace.

After opening the workspace, VS Code should ask you whether you want to install the *recommended extensions*:

```{image} ./images/vscode-install-extensions.png
:name: vscode-open-workspace
:align: center
```

The workspace comes with one recommended extension: [*Remote - Containers*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
This extension allows using a Docker image to specify a reproducible and versioned development environment.
More about that later.
Please click on *Install* to install the recommended extension.

Should VS Code not ask you to install the recommended extensions, you probably have the extension installed already.
To view the recommended extensions of the workspace and check whether they are installed, open the command palette by pressing `F1` and then choose *Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions*.

After installing the *Remote - Containers* extension you have to reopen the workspace within a *development container*.
To this end, open the command palette by pressing `F1` and then choose *Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container*.
This will reload the window, create a Docker container with Python and all relevant tools installed, and then opens the workspace in this container.

Congratulations, you are now fully prepared for the tutorial. ðŸŽ‰
